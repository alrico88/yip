# YiP (Year in Pixels)

YiP is a web app to track your mood throughout the year. 

A Year in Pixels chart is a visual representation of your mood over the course of a year, displayed in a grid format. The horizontal rows represent the months and the vertical columns represent the days of the month. Each square, or pixel, in the grid represents your average mood for that day. When viewed as a whole, the chart appears as a highly detailed image with each pixel representing a day in the year, hence the name 'Year in Pixels.'
